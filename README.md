This is a Python project that fetches up-to-date weather information for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.  
It displays each city’s detailed weather data in a table and also provides summary statistics like average temperature, highest/lowest temperature, and average humidity.

## Project Overview

This project allows anyone to:

- Check the current temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, visibility, and weather description of any city.
- Get a summary of multiple cities’ weather at once.
- Easily use it with minimal setup—no advanced technical knowledge required.

The project is ideal for beginners, students, or anyone curious about coding and weather data**.

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

Step 1: Set up environment to execute or run this pyhton scripst or code
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system or any other editor like vs code to run python code smoothly.

Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Download or clone this repositoryor simply the python code and paste it into your editor.
2. Replace your API key with API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" in python code line: 14 with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Run your code, install any modules if needed.

#Output
> The script will ask you to enter city names separated by commas:

> Enter city names separated by commas: London, New York, Tokyo
> If you leave it blank, the script will use default cities: London, New York, Tokyo, Sydney, Paris

# What You Will See
Individual city weather table:

City, country, temperature, feels like, humidity, pressure, weather description, wind speed, visibility, and timestamp.

Weather summary:

> Total cities fetched

> Average temperature

> Highest temperature

> Lowest temperature

> Average humidity
